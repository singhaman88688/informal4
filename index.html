    </div>
    <div>
        I hope that we will go like this forever. ❤️
    </div>
    <div>
        Sorry baby last time you became sad after reading...
    </div>
    <div>
        But, this time I will try not to repeat like that before... hehehe
    </div>
    <div>
        Baby you know, <br>before when I was at home, all my time was yours.
    </div>
    <div>
        I tried to gave my all possible time to you.
    </div>
    <div>
        Now, my semester has started. I have to study and go to class as well.
    </div>
    <div>
        But still, I am trying my best to give all my time to you.
    </div>
    <div>
        If it's less, then sorry baby. I will try my more best for you now.
    </div>
    <div>
        because, I never want you feel that I don't love you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I always love you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I love you before.
    </div>
    <div>
        I love you now.
    </div>
    <div>
        and I will love you in future as well.
    </div>
    <div>
        I love you.❤️
    </div>
    <div>
        You know babe, since the time I have come to college,
    </div>
    <div>
        We have started doing video call. I love it.
    </div>
    <div>
        In the morning before going to class, seeing you makes my day.
    </div>
    <div>
        In the night before going to sleep, seeing you makes my sleep comfortable.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why but I need you all the time.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why I never get tired of seeing you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why I always want to see you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why I always find my comfort in you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why I always become happy after seeing you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I don't know why I become sad when you are sad. I become happy when you are happy.
    </div>
    <div>
        because I love you is not the only reason for this.There is something more which I think only God knows.
    </div>
    <div>
        If we do video call for whole day, I can see you all the time.
    </div>
    <div>
        Every time seeing you gives me calmness, happiness and a form of peace...
    </div>
    <div>
        You don't know baby, but after coming to college, my love for you has increase soo much.
    </div>
    <div>
        I can't describe it in words.
    </div>
    <div>
        I love you...<br>I love you from my all.
    </div>
    <div>
        You are my most favourite person baby, <br>you are my comfort.
    </div>
    <div>
        I am grateful of having you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I know our boundaries are high, but I still want to be with you because I have hope in God that one day, we will
        be together.
    </div>
    <div>
        Baby, I know we fight sometimes for small small things but babe please never think of breaking it. 
    </div>
    <div>
        I know, there are misunderstandings which sometimes came up in between us. but we have to tackle them together.
    </div>
    <div>
        because it's not <br>'you v/s me' <br> but it's <br> 'you and me' v/s problem.
    </div>
    <div>
        Problems can never be bigger than our love.
    </div>
    <div>
        I miss you all the time.
    </div>
    <div>
        I cherish every moment we share and look forward to creating many more beautiful memories together.
    </div>
    <div>
        I fall more in love with you every single day, and I am excited for our journey ahead.
    </div>
    <div>
        You are my comfort baby.
    </div>
    <div>
        I can never think of leaving you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I can never think of hurting you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I love you baby.
    </div>
    <div>
        baby, don't ever think that I don't love you and never leave you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I promise to always love you, support you.
    </div>
    <div>
        I can't wait for the day we can celebrate our love in person, but until then, know that you are always in my
        heart.
